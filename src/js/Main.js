	* It will ensure that config has been loaded (path vars are available to be used) when you will require those in your module going forward.
	* e.g. If you load 'jquery' without path reference, it won't load from dependency. because at the time of loading jquery, its path is still undefined which will send the call to search it in baseUrl.
